## About The Project

<!-- [![Pilgram Demo][product-demo]](./src/images/pilgram-demo.gif) -->

This is a web application built for my friends and I so that we can keep track of the current "King Climber." You can see the current king, past kings, and add information following competitions to decide the new king climber. It was created for the Turing School of Software and Design's Module 3 final solo project. The overall goal was to demonstrate what we have learned after 5 months in the program.

The project specs can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html).

### Built With

* JS
* React
* React Router

## Usage

## Notes

I worked on this project for roughly three days. I'll continue to improve upon it and make my own backend because this is something my friends and I will actually use.

### Wins:

* thb not my best work, but I'm actually excited about this project and am excited to keep on improving it.

### Challenges:

* I've realized that I probably don't understand error handling relating to fetch calls as well as I thought I did. Also, I need to keep working on testing with Cypress and, also, improve my CSS skills

## Roadmap

- [ ] Create my own backend
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Improve UI
- [ ] DRY up code
